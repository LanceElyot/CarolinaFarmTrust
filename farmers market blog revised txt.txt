Where to Get Fresh Produce in Wilmington, NC
There’s nothing that says “summer” more than visiting a farmer’s market. Passing through the tents of lush salad greens, deep maroon beets, and bright red cherry tomatoes solidifies the feelings of summer. Though Wilmington is a beach town, there are many farms within 30-60 miles that provide produce and plants to our markets weekly. Check out this article to find out where all the local markets are; there are markets you can visit every day of the week!

The only co-op in Wilmington now hosts a farmer’s market every Saturday! This market prides itself on having only the most local of farmers joining in. If you can’t make it to the Saturday market, the co-op itself provides some of the same produce and meats daily.

Carolina Beach Farmer’s Market
Location: Carolina Beach Lake
Hours: Every Saturday 8AM-1PM, May to September
Carolina Beach’s farmer’s market is a staple for those who live there. With only two fully-stocked grocery stores on the island, having a fresh produce brought down every weekend is a treat. This market is also a mix of farmers and craft-makers, providing art and enrichment to the beach.
