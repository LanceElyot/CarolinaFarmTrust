Attached is a compilation of stock photos of vegetables, flowers, animals and birds for Carolina Farm Trust (CFT) to use on their social media and web sites in addition to CFT’s event photographs. These pictures are primarily my own pictures taken in my yard and some are from a friend’s yard who gave me permission to use them for this project. I also have included three potential social media prototype posts that can start a dialogue between the users of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and CFT. 
In Figure 1 I used a photo of a kohlrabi plant with the question, “What vegetable is this?” Many people are not familiar with growing nor eating kohlrabi so it provides people to take guesses or use their knowledge and provide the answer.  
 In Figure 2 there are two photos combined into one post of a cat and a rooster around a garden area with the question “Do you have any pictures to share of your pets enjoying your garden?” Pet owners love talking about their pets and have plenty of pictures to share. 
In Figure 3 I used a photo of a Japanese eggplant and wrote, “I like to grow Japanese eggplant because they are so easy to throw on the grill. I coat them in some olive oil a cook them for 2-3 minutes on each side and they are done. So easy to serve. How do you prepare your eggplant?” This prompts participants to share their recipes wether they grow the vegetables in their gardens or purchase them.
